            <h1> What we do</h1>
            <p>During the Chinese Lantern Festival, Franklin Square lights up the night. The can’t-miss illuminated fest in Philadelphia’s Historic District hosts dozens of massive, intricate and handcrafted lanterns — dragons, tigers, rabbits and more — constructed by lantern artisans from China. Also on the docket at this uber-popular ticketed event: live cultural performances, shopping, dining, the Dragon Beer Garden and more. The festival has been a must-see for residents and visitors since debuting in 2016 and has welcomed hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world.
